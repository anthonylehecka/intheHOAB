                Anyone walking about Chinatowns in America will observe statues of a stout fellow carrying a linen sack. 
                Chinese merchants call him Happy Chinaman or Laughing Buddha.
              </p><br>

                This Hotei lived in the T’ang dynasty. He had no desire to call himself a Zen master or to gather many disciples about him. 
                Instead he walked the streets with a big sack into which he would put gifts of candy, fruit, or doughnuts. 
                These he would give to children who gathered around him in play. He established a kindergarten of the streets.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                Whenever he met a Zen devotee he would extend his hand and say: 
                ‘Give me one penny.’ And if anyone asked him to return to a temple to teach others, again he would reply: ‘Give me one penny.’
              </p><br>
              <p>
                Once as he was about his play work another Zen master happened along and inquired: 
                ‘What is the significance of Zen?’ Hotei immediately plopped his sack down on the ground in silent answer.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                ‘Then,’ asked the other, ‘what is the actualization of Zen?’
                At once the Happy Chinaman swung the sack over his shoulder and continued on his way.

                from the place where the light came into being by itself, established [itself], and appeared in their image.’
                If they say to you, ‘Is it you?’ say, ‘We are its children, and we are the chosen of the living Father.’
                If they ask you, ‘What is the evidence of your Father in you?’ say to them, ‘It is motion and rest.’”

                ‘I do nothing at all’; thus would the truth-knower think, steadfast, – though seeing, 
                hearing, touching, smelling, going, eating, sleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, 
                seizing, opening and closing the eyes, – remembering that the senses move among sense objects.
